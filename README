See the branch `stack-demo` for the last time the code worked this way.

This is a codebase for experimenting with lazy specializing interpretation
strategies.  Currently implemented are:

    * Thyer's complete laziness semantics (sans memoization)
    * Bottom up beta substitution

To try it out, use measure.pl, like so:

    % perl measure.pl bubs 5

This runs the incredibly simple program 3*3 using the bubs (bottom up beta
substitution) interpreter at levels of interpretation from 0 to 5 (it is very
likely you will not be patient enough for this to finish).  So, for example, at
the 3rd level, it is running an interpreter running an interpreter running an
interpreter running 3*3.  

The other options are "thyer" and "ref".  "ref" is a simple embedding of HOAS
into Haskell, running (asymptotically) at the speed GHC would run this code. 
This also fails the test, getting exponentially slower with each level; waiting
for level 5 requires deep patience.

Here you can see thyer kick the pants off the other two.  It executes a
stack of interpreters 100 in just over half a second. (!)
